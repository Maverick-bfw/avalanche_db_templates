epsg code: "European Petroleum Survey Group Geodesy"; these code is a widely tool for indicating the spatial reference of geodata and includes the completely description of the used coordinate reference system for international exchange
coordinate zero: includes the x und y coordinate of the origin of every GIS-processed data; it is representing the upper most point of the digitized avalanche path
reviser: is the surname of the person who generated the present data
creation date: date of data generating
outline source: includes short information on which source the digitized data is based on (photo, field recording, gps, narration, chronicle)
outline type: includes short informtation about what part of the avalanche process the outline is representing (release, track, deposit)
evente date: is the date when the event, which the outline is representing, happend
pt no: ongoing number of the digitized anchor points
