##################################
avalanche name: the used designation of the avalanche, named by state institutions etc.; if there exist two "official" designations, use the one closer the the alphabetÂ´s A
epsg code: "European Petroleum Survey Group Geodesy"; these code is a widely tool for indicating the spatial reference of geodata and includes the completely description of the used coordinate reference system for international exchange
coordinate zero: includes the x und y coordinate of the origin of every GIS-processed data; it is representing the upper most point of the digitized avalanche path
dtm: digital terrain model; exact titling of the dtm-source; can be the online link or - if no online link known - the file path where the dtm is stored
pt type: includes short informtation about what part of the avalanche process the point is representing (release, track, deposit)
x: x-coordinate of the event-point
y: y-coordinate of the event-point
z: z-coordinate of the event-point
year: the year, in which the event took place
month: the month, in which the event took place
day: the day, on which the event took place
data source: short description about how the point was defined, either measurement (measured) or expert assessment (expert ass)
ID: is used to make each avalanche unique; so if there are two of them in the same year we can link a starting zone with a depo zone via the ID
classification: is the number used by the "Avalanche atlas - Illustrated international avalanche classification, UNESCO 1981" (page 30: "Morphological classification of avalanches"); for the sql db we will break the string up in table form
forest: is only if forest is in the "pt type" deposition zone or release zone  (track info is in header of .track-file)
outline: if there is an outline file corresponding to the event point choose "yes", if not choose "no"
vol: the calculated or estimated volume of the avalanche event in cubic meters
trigger: describes, how the avalanche was triggered after the reference "CAA OGRS 2014 p.51" (natural, artificial)

for track we put the point on the beta point this is a beta point from the field or made via gis expert defined. we will have a different place for beta from a model but that is a derivatives file.
